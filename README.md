# grocery_list
React and Node.js based live grocery application

GroceryLive is the final capstone project for the Bloc curriculum. This project is limited to one week, and should contain the following aspects: 

Functional Requirements
Minimum Requirements:

1. Save, Update, and Delete items to/from a database of your choosing.
2. Authenticate users - allowing the same user to be signed in from multiple devices.
3. Allow add, edit, delete, “mark as purchased”, and “unmark as purchased” on each item.
4. Keep the list synced in real time from each device.
5. Accompany your code with a full test suite.
6. Deploy your site to a web host (e.g., on Amazon EC2, Heroku, Netlify, Google AppEngine, etc.).

Things I would continue to do if given more time:
1. Integrate a framework for real time updates, like Socket.io
2. Integrate more policies around who gets to see what lists
    -for example: users only get to see their own lists, and lists they are invited to view
3. Create a smoother entry system for items, allowing people to add multiple items to a list at once.
